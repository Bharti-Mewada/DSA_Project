    <h4>1)Stack</h4><p class="lead ">A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure 
	which can be commonly found in many programming languages.
	This structure is named as “stack” because it resembles a real-world stack — a stack of plates.</p>
	<h4>2)Queue</h4><p class="lead ">A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure 
	which can be commonly found in many programming languages. 
	This structure is named as “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue — people waiting in a queue.</p>
	<h4>3)Linked List</h4><p class="lead ">A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order 
	which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. 
	Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.</p>
	<h4>4)Trees</h4><p class="lead ">A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.
Various types of trees have been developed throughout the past decades, in order to suit certain applications and meet certain constraints.
 Some examples are binary search tree, B tree,, red-black tree, AVL tree.
</p>
	<h4>5)Graphs</h4><p class="lead ">A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.
The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.
Two nodes are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.</p>
